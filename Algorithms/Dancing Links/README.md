## Dancing-Links in Java

This is a Java implementation of Knuth's [Dancing Links](www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/papers/dancing.ps.gz) algorithm for solving exact cover problems efficiently.

Currently, it can

* Solve an exact cover problem (given an int[][] with 0's and 1's)
* Generate solutions to a sudoku board
