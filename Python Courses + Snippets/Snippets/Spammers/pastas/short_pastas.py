def gaming_laptop():

    Today when I walked into my economics class I saw something I dread every time I close my eyes. Someone had brought
    their new gaming laptop to class. The Forklift he used to bring it was still running idle at the back. I started
    sweating as I sat down and gazed over at the 700lb beast that was his laptop. He had already reinforced his desk
    with steel support beams and was in the process of finding an outlet for a power cable thicker than Amy Schumer's
    thigh. I start shaking. I keep telling myself I'm going to be alright and that there's nothing to worry about.
    He somehow finds a fucking outlet. Tears are running down my cheeks as I send my last texts to my family
    saying I love them. The teacher starts the lecture, and the student turns his laptop on. The colored lights
    on his RGB Backlit keyboard flare to life like a nuclear flash, and a deep humming fills my ears and shakes
    my very soul. The entire city power grid goes dark. The classroom begins to shake as the massive fans begin
    to spin. In mere seconds my world has gone from vibrant life, to a dark, earth shattering void where my
    body is getting torn apart by the 150mph gale force winds and the 500 decibel groan of the cooling fans.
    As my body finally surrenders, I weep, as my school and my city go under. I fucking hate gaming laptops.

    going ‚Äúhuh? huh? huh?‚Äù and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my 
    shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to 
    walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very 
    nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúSir, you need to pay for those first.‚Äù At first he kept pretending 
    to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took 
    one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each 
    individually 'to prevent any electrical infetterence', and then turned around and winked at me. I don‚Äôt even think 
    that‚Äôs a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, 
    he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."""

    I have to say a lot of people have been asking this question. No, really. A lot of people come up to me and they
    ask me. They say, 'What's 2+2?' And I tell them look, we know what 2+2 is. We've had almost eight years of the
    worst kind of math you can imagine. Oh my god, I can't believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and
    the 3s. Its terrible. Its just terrible. Look, if you want to know what 2+2 is, do you want to know what 2+2 is?
    I'll tell you. First of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it
    is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it.
    A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's
    a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, '10101000101',
    on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I don't know. I mean,
    you know. So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even.
    Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better
    at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell you. So, we're gonna be the best on
    2+2, believe me. OK? Alright. Thank you." Reporter 1: "But what actually is 2+2?" Trump: "Siddown. No, siddown.
    I've already answered your question. Haven't I already answered your question. This is what we get from news
    reporters, folks. Give me a nice question. Yes - you." Reporter 2: "Is your name Donald Trump?" Trump:
    "Now that's a nice question, folks. That's what I want."
