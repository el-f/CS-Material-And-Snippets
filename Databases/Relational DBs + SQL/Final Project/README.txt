Vaccination Management System Project
	By Gal Karasnty
	 & Elazar Fine

****************************************

We have changed the project according to the correction we've been given
during the presentation - we've added a 'dose' entity so now
each vaccination log has a specific "bottle/dose" barcode (instead of just a vaccine_id).

This structure change made us rewrite queries and add/delete triggers/procedures,
we updated the changes in the presentation and we attached the two versions, before and after the corrections.
