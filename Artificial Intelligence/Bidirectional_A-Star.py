        *** Bidirectional A-Star algorithm ***

Useful for real road network graph problems, on a planar map/grid.

n - number of nodes 
m - number of edges

If the graph isn't dense, ie. it's sparse, it's better to implement
priority queue as heap than as array.
A graph is sparse when n and m are of the same order of magnitude.

Here, priority queue is implemented by using module heapq.

We put (dist, name) into heap, where dist is f(v), and f(v) = g(v) + h(v),
that is, known part + heuristic part.
Known part is correct distance from starting vertex, s, to this one, v.
Heuristic part is estimation from this vertex, v, to the target vertex, t.

This version of the algorithm assumes that we are given
coordinates of vertices, so we can calculate Euclidean
distances and use it as our heuristics function.
An alternative heuristic would be Manhattan distance,
but Euclidean is used in a case like this (road network).

This is Bidirectional A-Star algorithm, without landmarks.
This is directed search, thanks to heuristic (potential) function.
It represents Dijkstra with Potentials.
This means that this is just plain Dijkstra with new edge weights.
Actually, if heuristic (potential) function is identical to 0,
this is identical to the UCS Dijkstra.

It's probably the best to compute the heuristic on the fly.
A-Star is directed search, which means not many vertices
will be processed. If, on the other hand, we want to precompute
the heuristic function, we have to do that for every vertex of the graph,
because we don't know in advance which vertices will be processed.
In each query, the heuristic will be different, because target vertex
will be different, and heuristic is target-dependent.

A-Star with heuristics doesn't need the preprocessing phase.
We can have it, but it will only make the algorithm slower.
In other words, it doesn't make sense. That's because heuristic values depend
on a single query - they are not common to many queries in a graph.

This version of the algorithm doesn't reconstruct the shortest path.
It only computes its length and returns it.

This bidirectional variant is the fastest one.
